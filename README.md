# Pesticide-usage-and-Inisghts-analysis

## Dataset Analysis Overview

This analysis provides insights into a dataset containing information about pesticide usage across different domains, areas, elements, items, years, units, and values. The objective is to identify trends, patterns, and outliers in pesticide usage to better understand how and where pesticides are being applied.

## Dataset Columns
- **Domain:** The category of usage (e.g., agricultural, industrial).
- **Area:** The geographical region where the pesticide is used.
- **Element:** The chemical component of the pesticide.
- **Item:** The specific product or substance.
- **Year:** The year of data collection.
- **Unit:** The measurement unit for the pesticide value.
- **Value:** The quantity of pesticide usage.

## Key Questions and Insights

### 1. Which areas have the highest pesticide usage?
By aggregating pesticide usage values by area, we identify the top regions where pesticides are most heavily used. This helps in focusing regulatory and environmental efforts.

### 2. How has pesticide usage changed over the years?
Analyzing the yearly pesticide usage trends reveals whether there is an increase or decrease in pesticide application over time, indicating the effectiveness of policies and changes in agricultural practices.

### 3. What are the top elements contributing to pesticide usage?
Identifying the most used chemical elements in pesticides can help in assessing potential environmental and health risks associated with these chemicals.

### 4. Which items have the highest pesticide usage?
Understanding which products or substances have the highest pesticide usage can guide targeted interventions and more sustainable practices.

### 5. How does pesticide usage vary between different domains?
A domain-wise breakdown of pesticide usage helps in understanding how different sectors contribute to overall pesticide application, facilitating sector-specific strategies.

### 6. Which unit of measurement is most commonly used for reporting pesticide usage?
Knowing the prevalent units of measurement standardizes reporting and comparison across different datasets and studies.

### 7. Are there any noticeable trends or patterns in pesticide usage across different areas and items?
A heatmap visualization of pesticide usage across various areas and items can reveal hidden patterns and correlations that are not immediately obvious from raw data.

## Additional Insights

### 8. Which years have seen the highest increase or decrease in pesticide usage?
Year-over-year percentage changes highlight periods of significant increases or decreases, providing context for external factors influencing pesticide usage.

### 9. What is the average pesticide usage per area?
Calculating the average pesticide usage per area helps in understanding the typical levels of pesticide application, useful for benchmarking and identifying outliers.

### 10. Is there any seasonality in pesticide usage over the years?
Seasonal trends in pesticide usage can inform the timing of pesticide application and its correlation with agricultural cycles.

### 11. How does pesticide usage correlate with different items in different areas?
Correlation analysis between items and areas can identify potential associations and dependencies, guiding more efficient use of pesticides.

### 12. What are the outlier areas with unusually high or low pesticide usage?
Identifying outlier regions with atypical pesticide usage helps in focusing investigations and mitigating potential environmental impacts.

### 13. How does the distribution of pesticide usage look across different domains?
Distribution analysis through box plots provides a detailed view of the spread and central tendency of pesticide usage within each domain.

### 14. Which combination of area and element has the highest pesticide usage?
Finding the top area-element combinations reveals the most critical intersections that require attention for regulatory measures and environmental protection.

## Visualization Theme
All visualizations use a green color theme to maintain consistency and emphasize the environmental aspect of pesticide usage.

## Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis of the pesticide usage dataset provides valuable insights into various dimensions of pesticide application. By understanding these patterns, stakeholders can make informed decisions to promote sustainable practices and mitigate potential risks associated with pesticide use.
